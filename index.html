<!-- 
  ==> HTML : 
  Created circle with with classes [clock => clock face => hand * 3 + hand for each task]

  ==> CSS :
  Styled the circle and the hands to make them inside the clock
  applied transform : rotate (deg) !! the place of transform-origin by default is 50% of the x axis
  applied transform-origin : 100%
  applied transform : rotate (90deg) to make it looks nice and at 00:00 by default
  applied transition : all 0.4s + transition-timing-function : to something make it looks nice 
  
  ==> Js
  created setDates() + setInterval(function, time in milliseconds) for this function
  setDates => get the date => get seconds 
  now we have seconds! what we should do to make them show up on screen! => turn them to degrees :)
  secondsDegrees => (( seconds / 60) * 360) + the offset which is 90Â°
  select the second-hand => .style.transform = ` rotate (#{secondsDegrees}) `
