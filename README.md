## My process

==> HTML :
Created circle with with classes [clock => clock face => hand * 3 + hand for each task]

==> CSS :
Styled the circle and the hands to make them inside the clock
applied transform : rotate (deg) !! the place of transform-origin by default is 50% of the x axis
applied transform-origin : 100%
applied transform : rotate (90deg) to make it looks nice and at 00:00 by default
applied transition : all 0.4s + transition-timing-function : to something make it looks nice

==> Js
created setDates() + setInterval(function, time in milliseconds) for this function
setDates => get the date => get seconds
now we have seconds! what we should do to make them show up on screen! => turn them to degrees :)
secondsDegrees => (( seconds / 60) \* 360) + the offset which is 90Â°
select the second-hand => .style.transform = `rotate (#{secondsDegrees})`
